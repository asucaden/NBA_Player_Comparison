# NBA Player Comparision

Did you know that last year, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had almost the same amount of points, rebounds and assists as superstar Steph Curry? Discover more comparisons like this with the NBA Player Comparison tool.

### Description

The NBA Player Comparison website shows you one player comparison at a time.  If you find a comparison interesting, mark it as tweet-worthy and it will be queued up to be tweeted from my twitter bot.  If no one uses the website (likely), no need to worry!  The twitter bot, @c_swish_stats, will continue to tweet interesting comparisons all on its own.  Visit <a href="https://cswishstats.com" target="_blank">cswishstats.com</a> to check out some player comparisons and give the bot a follow <a href="http://twitter.com/c_swish_stats/" target="_blank">@c_swish_stats on Twitter</a>

### Under the hood

This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to show potentially interesting comparisons to users. These comparisons are generated by querying player statistics from the current NBA season that I store in MongoDB. Stats are updated nightly thanks to <a href="https://www.balldontlie.io" target="_blank">Ball Dont Lie API</a>.

Once you indicate that a comparison is interesting on <a href="http://www.cswishstats.com" target="_blank">cswishstats.com</a>, that interesting pair is stored in MongoDB and periodically tweeted out on @c_swish_stats (give it a follow!)

Website is hosted an on an Ubuntu Server on AWS running nginx.
Twitter bot is powered by AWS Lambda, deployed with the serverless framework.
